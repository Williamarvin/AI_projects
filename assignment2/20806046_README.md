Problem 2 A* search

To run the file, aside from the given libraries heapq, I used 2 additional ones, which is math and argparse

As stated in the pdf, it can receive 3 Arguments 
--maze or -m with an input file 
--path or -p with output file that is already provided
--nodes or -n with output file that is already provided

If nodes and path is not provided, that no txt file will be output

Just need to run python 20806048_problem2.py
add the arguments if needed if not, default values will be used
by default, the output will be printed in the cmd

To change the heuristic value, just change the code in line 33 and 70 to the respective heuristic function h1, h2 and h3

**DONE**
